-- Configs relating to the `mini.nvim` family of utility plugins.
--
-- Although it's not at all required, I do like having a nice start screen with
-- information about what I should be doing. `mini-starter` is used for this.
-- It also cycles through the list of oblique strategies, printing them at the 
-- bottom of the page.
--
-- Again, not at all required, but having a statusline with useful info that
-- doesn't look like dogshit is nice. `mini-statusline` for this.
