# A Hobby

Mainly garbage.

Prerequisites:

- Treesitter.
- Neovim on path (I'm using nightly).
- Some language runtimes, else some of the tooling probs ain't going to work.
- Lua & luarocks on path if faffing around is required.
- A font patched with powerline symbols set in yr terminal (not essential afaik).
